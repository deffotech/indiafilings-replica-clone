                  Setting up a business in India often involves choosing a private limited company as a preferred option. This structure offers 
                  shareholders limited liability protection while placing specific ownership constraints. In contrast, in the case of an LLP, 
                  partners oversee the management. Private limited company registration allows for a clear distinction between directors and 
                  shareholders.

                  In India, a private limited company is a privately held entity with limited liability, and it ranks among the nation's most favored 
                  business structures. This popularity is primarily attributed to its numerous advantages, including limited liability protection, 
                  ease of formation and maintenance, and its status as a distinct legal entity. This encourages a prospective businessman to 
                  engage in the incorporation of private limited company. A private limited company enjoys legal separation from its owners and 
                  necessitates a minimum of two members and two directors for its operation. Here are the key characteristics of a private 
                  limited company in India, which justify the PVT LTD company registration:
